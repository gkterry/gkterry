- My name is Greg and I have been involved with maintaining and using computers for several decades
- I enjoy using Linux, primarily Debian as I am not real fond of the endless update cycle of rolling releases. I also use Mac Os but much prefer open source software
- I like to discover and create ways to make computer usage more efficient for the user and for myself
- I don't expect to create much in the way of code for a bit. I'm going to study some new (to me) programming languages for a while.
